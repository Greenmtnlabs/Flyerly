### flyerlyParsecode
========

If we want to change any thing in database of parse we have to create parse cloud code, then deploy this code on parse server.
```sh
parse deploy
```
We can call parse cloud function from terminal using base script.
Right now we have a code for checking users whome haven't appName
```sh
bash appNameNotExistCount.sh
```
for calling script code is writter in this bash file.
